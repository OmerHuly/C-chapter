/*
GAME OF LIFE:
Each cell can be dead or alive.
Each game starts by drawing a pattern and then watch it as it evolves.
A cell becomes alive if exactly 3 nearby cells are alive (birth).
A cell stays alive if 2 or 3 nearby cells are alive (survival).
In all other cases, a cell dies or remains dead (overcrowding or loneliness).

The Rules:
Each cell with 3 neighbors becomes populated.
Each cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives.
Each cell with 1 or less neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
Each cell with 4 or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
